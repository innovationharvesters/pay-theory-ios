/// A class that manages payment processing through the Pay Theory service.
///
/// The `PayTheory` class provides a comprehensive interface for handling various payment methods,
/// including card payments, ACH transfers, and cash transactions. It manages the state of each
/// payment method, calculates service fees, and handles communication with the Pay Theory servers.
///
/// This class conforms to `ObservableObject`, allowing SwiftUI views to react to changes in its state,
/// and `WebSocketProtocol` for handling real-time communication with the Pay Theory service.
///
/// - Important: Always check the `isReady` property before attempting to process payments to ensure
///   the instance has completed initialization.
///
/// - Note: This class uses combine framework for reactive programming and DeviceCheck for secure device attestation.
